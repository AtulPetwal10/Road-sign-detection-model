# Road-sign-detection-model

<h3>best1 and best2 are two models trained over differnt data set</h3>
<h2>execution-</h2><br>
<p>1.open file road_sign_detection_model<br>
    2.execute each cell in sequence
          <h4>note-</h4>last cell is for real time predection better to run that cell if your system have gpu in it.
  3.you are good to go.
</p>

<h3>if its not working for every sign dont worry about it.
both the models are trained over a small and diffrent dataset
use the image from test image folder or the videos from demo input output folder
thank you</h3>

<h1>for non gpu system-</h1>h1>
<h3>use google collab as it provides the gpu runtime environment</h3>
<br>
<h1>dataset-</h1>
<h3>i havent't uploaded the dataset in the following repo.
